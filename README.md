# serverless-demos-in-fission

Fission (https://github.com/fission/fission) is a framework for serverless functions on Kubernetes, which maintains a  configurable pool of containers.

We have developed some serverless demos, which are based on existing microservice or workflow applications, for fission.

Currently implemented demos:
* **gcp-microservices-demo**: a web application based on GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo)
